    "# Taylor series and approximations\n",
    "\n",
    "Taylor series is one the best tools maths has to offer for approximating functions. Taylor series is about taking non-polynomial functions and finding polyomials that approximate at some input. The motive here is the polynomials tend to be much easier to deal with than other functions, they are easier to compute, take derivatives, integrate, just easier overall. "

    "## Potential energy of a simple pendulum\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the potential energy of a pendulum, for that we need an expression for how high the weight of the pendulum is above its lowest point. This works out to be  $h = R(1 - \\cos(\\theta))$ The cosine function made the problem awkward and unweildy. But, if we approximate the $\\cos(\\theta) \\approx 1 + \\frac{\\theta^2}{2}$ of all things, everything just fell into place much more easily. An approximation like that might seem completely out of left field. If we graph these functions, they do look close to each other for small angles.\n"
